The number of sites which publish data related to Covid-19 is enormous. Of all these, I have a few favourites.

- Covid Trends ([link](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/)) by Aatish Bhatia and MinutePhysics takes an alternative approach by not plotting cases vs time, but cases vs growth. This has the benefit of clearly showing when the growth trend is breaking.
- Daily updated COVID-19 cases ([link](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2020/03/daily-updated-covid-19-cases/)) by Dr. Drang plots data for the US in a clear way. As always, Dr. Drang produces crips plots.
- C19.se ([link](https://c19.se)) shows data for Sweden in great detail. Updates daily with data not only from John Hopkins, but also from the Swedish government.
- FOHM Covid-19 ([link](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa)) by the Public Health Agency of Sweden shows time-corrected data for Sweden and various distributions such as age and region.
